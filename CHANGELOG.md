# Changelog

All notable changes to `assert-healthy` are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.0.0 — Initial release

### Added

- `assert-healthy` GitHub Action: assert one or more uptimemonitoring.com monitors are healthy.
- Inputs: `api-key`, `monitor-ids` (comma- or newline-separated), `strict-flapping` (default `true`), `unknown-retry-delay-seconds` (default `10`).
- Outputs: `unhealthy-count`, `unhealthy-ids`.
- Status mapping: `up` → pass, `down` → fail, `flapping` → fail (or pass with `strict-flapping: false`), `unknown` → retry once then fail.
- Distinct exit codes: `1` (unhealthy), `2` (input error), `3` (all transport errors).
- Step summary table with one row per monitor.
- CI: lint, typecheck, test (≥90% line coverage), build, and a `dist/`-in-sync guard.
- Weekly canary workflow that runs the action against a known-up and known-down monitor and files a labelled issue on mismatch.
- Release workflow that force-moves the major-version ref (`v1`) to the latest tagged release.
